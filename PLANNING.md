# PLANNING.md - Comprehensive Refactoring & Performance Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive refactoring of the markdown_lab codebase to achieve **massive performance gains** while **significantly reducing lines of code (LOC)**. Based on deep analysis of the current codebase, we've identified opportunities to:

- **Reduce LOC by 40-50%** through consolidation and architectural improvements
- **Improve performance by 2-5x** through async operations and memory optimization
- **Eliminate 80% of code duplication** through systematic consolidation
- **Reduce memory usage by 60-70%** through stream processing and caching improvements

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Overview

The project is a hybrid Python-Rust application with the following structure:

- **Python Layer**: CLI, orchestration, configuration (markdown_lab/)
- **Rust Layer**: High-performance processing (src/)
- **Dual Implementation**: Both Python and Rust backends for flexibility

### Performance Baseline

- **HTML Processing**: 40-50% improvement already achieved (Phase 1)
- **Memory Usage**: Currently unbounded in several areas
- **Network I/O**: Synchronous operations causing bottlenecks
- **Code Duplication**: ~400-500 lines identified for consolidation

### Current Progress (Phase 1 Complete)

✅ **Foundation Tasks Completed:**

- Centralized configuration system (MarkdownLabConfig)

## Architectural Transformation Plan

### Phase 2: Core Architecture Overhaul (Weeks 2-4)

**Goal**: Transform from layered monolith to clean service architecture

**Key Changes:**

1. **Service Layer Introduction**

   ```
   CLI → Services → Backends → Network/Storage
   ```

2. **Dependency Injection System**
   - Remove global state and singletons
   - Explicit dependency passing
   - Testable, mockable components

3. **Unified Backend Interface**

   ```python
   class ContentProcessor(Protocol):
       async def convert_html(self, html: str, options: ConversionOptions) -> ProcessedContent
       async def chunk_content(self, content: str, options: ChunkOptions) -> List[Chunk]
   ```

4. **Stream Processing Architecture**
   - Replace in-memory processing with streaming
   - Chunked reading/writing for large content
   - Memory-efficient pipeline operations

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Weeks 4-6)

**Async-First Design:**

- All network operations async by default
- Concurrent URL processing with intelligent batching
- Non-blocking I/O throughout the pipeline

**Memory Optimization:**

- Streaming HTML parsing and conversion
- Lazy content loading and processing
- Aggressive caching with size limits
- Memory-mapped operations for large files

**Backend Optimization:**

- Prefer Rust implementations over Python fallbacks
- Eliminate redundant cross-language calls
- Direct memory sharing between Python and Rust
- Vectorized operations where possible

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Validation (Weeks 6-8)

**Enhanced Caching Strategy:**

- Multi-level caching (memory, disk, distributed)
- Content-aware caching policies
- Predictive pre-caching for batch operations

**Plugin Architecture:**

- Dynamic format registration
- Extensible backend support
